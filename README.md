### The brief 

Using the Events JSON provided (https://t-bridge.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/events.json) and also the design brief provided (https://t-bridge.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/skyway-whats-on.png), the task was to create a 'What's On' listing page. There should be a page listing the events, with details for each event. Each event should display the image, the title and the dates as a minimum. There should also be a free text search field where the user can filter the events by title.

This application was writte in Vue.js.
